# Tree-LSTM

In the final part of this lab we will exploit the tree structure of the SST data. 
Until now we only used the surface tokens, but remember that our data examples include binary trees with a sentiment score at every node.

In particular, we will implement **N-ary Tree-LSTMs** which are described in:

> Kai Sheng Tai, Richard Socher, and Christopher D. Manning. [Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P15/P15-1150.pdf) ACL 2015.

Since our trees are binary (i.e., N=2), we can refer to these as *Binary Tree-LSTMs*. If you study equations (9) to (14) in the paper, you will find that they are not all too different from the original LSTM that you already have.

You should read this paper carefully and make sure that you understand the approach. You will also find our LSTM baseline there.
Note however that Tree-LSTMs were proposed around the same time by two other groups:

> Phong Le and Willem Zuidema. [Compositional distributional semantics with long short term memory](http://anthology.aclweb.org/S/S15/S15-1002.pdf). *SEM 2015.

> Xiaodan Zhu, Parinaz Sobihani,  and Hongyu Guo. [Long short-term memory over recursive structures](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/zhub15.pdf). ICML 2015.

It is good scientific practice to cite all three papers in your report.

## Computation

Do you remember the `transitions_from_treestring` function all the way in the beginning of this lab? Every example contains a **transition sequence** produced by this function. Let's look at it again:
"""

ex = next(examplereader("trees/dev.txt"))
print(TreePrettyPrinter(ex.tree))
print("Transitions:")
print(ex.transitions)

"""Note that the tree is **binary**. Every node has two children, except for pre-terminal nodes.

A tree like this can be described by a sequence of **SHIFT (0)** and **REDUCE (1)** actions.

To construct a tree, we can use the transitions as follows:
- **reverse** the sentence (a list of tokens) and call this the **buffer**
   - the first word is now on top (last in the list), and we would get it when calling pop() on the buffer
- create an empty list and call it the **stack**
- iterate through the transition sequence:
  - if it says SHIFT(0), we pop a word from the buffer, and push it to the stack
  - if it says REDUCE(1), we pop the **top two items** from the stack, and combine them (e.g. with a Tree-LSTM!), creating a new node that we push back on the stack

Convince yourself that going through the transition sequence above will result in the tree that you see.
For example, we would start by putting the following words on the stack (by shifting 5 times, starting with `It`):

```
Top of the stack:
-----------------
film
lovely
a 
's  
It
```
Now we find a REDUCE in the transition sequence, so we get the top two words (film and lovely), and combine them, so our new stack becomes:
```
Top of the stack:
-----------------
lovely film
a 
's  
It
```

We will use this approach when encoding sentences with our Tree-LSTM.
Now, our sentence is a reversed list of word embeddings.
When we shift, we move a word embedding to the stack.
When we reduce, we apply the Tree-LSTM to the top two vectors, and the result is a single vector that we put back on the stack.
After going through the whole transition sequence, we will have the root node on our stack! We can use that to classify the sentence.

## Obtaining the transition sequence

So what goes on in the `transitions_from_treestring` function?

The idea ([explained in this blog post](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/recursive-neural-networks-pytorch/)) is that, if we had a tree, we could traverse through the tree, and every time that we find a node containing only a word, we output a SHIFT.
Every time **after** we have finished visiting the children of a node, we output a REDUCE.
(What is this tree traversal called?)

However, our `transitions_from_treestring` function operates directly on the string representation. It works as follows.

We start with the representation:

```
(3 (2 It) (4 (4 (2 's) (4 (3 (2 a) (4 (3 lovely) (2 film))) (3 (2 with) (4 (3 (3 lovely) (2 performances)) (2 (2 by) (2 (2 (2 Buy) (2 and)) (2 Accorsi))))))) (2 .)))
```

First we remove pre-terminal nodes (and add spaces before closing brackets):

```
(3 It (4 (4 's (4 (3 a (4 lovely film ) ) (3 with (4 (3 lovely performances ) (2 by (2 (2 Buy and )  Accorsi ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
```

Then we remove node labels:

```
( It ( ( 's ( ( a ( lovely film ) ) ( with ( ( lovely performances) ( by ( ( Buy and )  Accorsi ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
```

Then we remove opening brackets:

```
It 's a lovely film ) ) with lovely performances ) by Buy and ) Accorsi ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
```

Now we replace words by S (for SHIFT), and closing brackets by R (for REDUCE):

```
S S S S S R R S S S R S S S R S R R R R R R S R R
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 
```

Et voil√†. We just obtained the transition sequence!

seq = ex.transitions
s = " ".join(["S" if t == 0 else "R" for t in seq])
print(s)

"""## Coding the Tree-LSTM

The code below contains a Binary Tree-LSTM cell.
It is used in the TreeLSTM class below it, which in turn is used in the TreeLSTMClassifier.
The job of the TreeLSTM class is to encode a complete sentence and return the root node.
The job of the TreeLSTMCell is to return a new state when provided with two children (a reduce action). By repeatedly calling the TreeLSTMCell, the TreeLSTM will encode a sentence. This can be done for multiple sentences at the same time.


#### Exercise 
Check the `forward` function and complete the Tree-LSTM formulas.
You can see that we defined a large linear layer for you, that projects the *concatenation* of the left and right child into the input gate, left forget gate, right forget gate, candidate, and output gate.

"""## Explanation of the TreeLSTM class


The code below contains the TreeLSTM class, which implements everything we need in order to encode a sentence from word embeddings. The calculations are the same as in the paper, implemented such that the class `TreeLSTMCell` above is as general as possible and only takes two children to reduce them into a parent. 


**Initialize $\mathbf{h}$ and $\mathbf{c}$ outside of the cell for the leaves**

At the leaves of each tree the children nodes are **empty**, whereas in higher levels the nodes are binary tree nodes that *do* have a left and right child (but no input $x$). By initializing the leaf nodes outside of the cell class (`TreeLSTMCell`), we avoid if-else statements in the forward pass.

The `TreeLSTM` class (among other things) pre-calculates an initial $h$ and $c$ for every word in the sentence. Since the initial left and right child are 0, the only calculations we need to do are based on $x$, and we can drop the forget gate calculation (`prev_c_l` and `prev_c_r` are zero). The calculations we do in order to initalize $h$ and $c$ are then:

$$
c_1 =  W^{(u)}x_1 \\
o_1 = \sigma (W^{(i)}x_1) \\
h_1 = o_1 \odot \text{tanh}(c_1)$$
*NB: note that these equations are chosen as initializations of $c$ and $h$, other initializations are possible and might work equally well.*

**Sentence Representations**

All our leaf nodes are now initialized, so we can start processing the sentence in its tree form. Each sentence is represented by a buffer (initially a list with a concatenation of $[h_1, c_1]$ for every word in the reversed sentence), a stack (initially an empty list) and a transition sequence. To encode our sentence, we construct the tree from its transition sequence as explained earlier. 

*A short example that constructs a tree:*

We loop over the time dimension of the batched transition sequences (i.e. row by row), which contain values of 0's, 1's and 2's (representing SHIFT, REDUCE and padding respectively). If we have a batch of size 2 where the first example has a transition sequence given by [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1] and the second by [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], our transition batch will be given by the following two-dimensional numpy array:

$$
\text{transitions} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0\\ 
0 & 0\\ 
1 & 1\\ 
0 & 0\\ 
0 & 0\\ 
0 & 1\\ 
1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
The inner loop (`for transition, buffer, stack in zip(t_batch, buffers, stacks)`) goes over each example in the batch and updates its buffer and stack. The nested loop for this example will then do roughy the following:

```
Time = 0:  t_batch = [0, 0], the inner loop performs 2 SHIFTs. 

Time = 1:  t_batch = [0, 0], ".."

Time = 2:  t_batch = [1, 1], causing the inner loop to fill the list child_l and child_r for both examples in the batch. Now the statement if child_l will return True, triggering a REDUCE action to be performed by our Tree LSTM cell with a batch size of 2. 

Time = 3:  t_batch = [0, 0], "..".

Time = 4:  t_batch = [0, 0], ".."

Time = 5:  t_batch = [0, 1], one SHIFT will be done and another REDUCE action will be performed by our Tree LSTM, this time of batch size 1.  

Time = 6:  t_batch = [1, 2], triggering another REDUCE action with batch size 1.
```
*NB: note that this was an artificial example for the purpose of demonstrating parts of the code, the transition sequences do not necessarily represent actual trees.*

**Batching and Unbatching**

Within the body of the outer loop over time, we use the functions for batching and unbatching. 

*Batching*

Before passing two lists of children to the reduce layer (an instance of `TreeLSTMCell`), we batch the children as they are at this point a list of tensors of variable length based on how many REDUCE actions there are to perform at a certain time step across the batch (let's call the length `L`). To do an efficient forward pass we want to transform the list to a pair of tensors of shape `([L, D], [L, D])`, which the function `batch` achieves. 

*Unbatching*

In the same line where we batched the children, we unbatch the output of the forward pass to become a list of states of length `L` again. We do this because we need to loop over each example's transition at the current time step and push the children that are reduced into a parent to the stack.

*The batch and unbatch functions let us switch between the "PyTorch world" (Tensors) and the Python world (easy to manipulate lists).*
